# Agent Instructions

This project uses **littlefactory** for task management. Tasks are stored in `.littlefactory/tasks.json`.

## Quick Reference

Tasks are managed automatically by the littlefactory driver. Manual task management is not typically needed, but the JSON format is:
- `status: "todo"` - Available for work
- `status: "in_progress"` - Currently being worked on
- `status: "done"` - Completed

## Conventions

- Whenever you create a new `AGENTS.md` file, also create a `CLAUDE.md` symlink next to it pointing to it (e.g., `ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md`).
